HOW TO GET THESE FILES:
====================================================================

OPTION 1: Via Git (When push works)
- The files are committed locally
- Once git push succeeds, go to: https://github.com/Misha70707/me-July
- Navigate to branch: claude/hello-nic-011CUqgQcSHTuLW4HvuAB37x
- Download the MQL5 folder
- Copy files to your MT5 data folder

OPTION 2: Access via WSL (If you have Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Open WSL terminal
- Navigate to: /home/user/me-July/MQL5/
- Copy files to your Windows MT5 folder

OPTION 3: Ask Claude Code to paste smaller chunks
- I can break each file into smaller parts
- Copy each part separately into MT5 MetaEditor

OPTION 4: Wait for git push to succeed
- All files are safely committed
- Once auth refreshes, they'll auto-push to GitHub
- Then you can download from there
